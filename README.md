# Harnessing Google Earth Engine for Ecological Insights: Climate, Weather, and Forest Structure Analysis with Python

When: 1-4pm, Thursday, June 26, 2025

Where: ES 4001

### Workshop Description:
This hands-on workshop introduces ecologists to the powerful capabilities of Google Earth Engine (GEE) for extracting and analyzing environmental data. Participants will learn how to leverage GEEâ€™s vast satellite and climate data archives to explore ecological patterns and processes at local to global scales.

Using Python as the primary interface, the workshop will guide attendees through:

Accessing and processing climate and weather datasets (e.g., temperature, precipitation, humidity) from sources like ERA5. Extracting and analyzing forest structure metrics, including canopy height, biomass, and land cover classification using datasets in the Awesome GEE Community Catalog (https://gee-community-catalog.org/).

Integrating GEE with Python libraries (e.g., geemap, earthengine-api, pandas, matplotlib) for advanced data visualization and analysis.

This workshop will demonstrate how to create reproducible workflows for data acquisition and processing to facilitate research.

Who Should Attend: Students with interest in ecological applications of remote sensing. A basic understanding of Python is considered an asset but not required.

**Key Takeaways:**

Practical skills in using GEE and Python for ecological data extraction and analysis. Understanding of key remote sensing datasets relevant to climate and forest ecology. Tools to build scalable, cloud-based workflows for environmental research.

Format: Interactive coding sessions, real-world case studies, and guided exercises.
