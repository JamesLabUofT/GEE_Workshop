        "\n",
        "### Module Overview:\n",
        "\n",
        "This module introduces participants to the fundamentals of accessing, processing, and extracting climate data—specifically ERA5 reanalysis data—using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python. Through hands-on coding exercises in Google Colab, participants will learn how to build scalable workflows for climate data analysis relevant to ecological and environmental research.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Learning Objectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this module, participants will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Understand the structure and content of ERA5 datasets available in GEE.\n",
        "* Use Python and the Earth Engine API to access and filter ERA5 data by time and region.\n",
        "* Extract and visualize climate variables (e.g., precipitation, temperature) over custom geographic areas.\n",
        "* Export processed data for further analysis or reporting.\n",
