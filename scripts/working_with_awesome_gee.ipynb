        "## Module Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "This module introduces participants to accessing, analyzing, and visualizing forest-related geospatial datasets from the Awesome GEE Community Data Catalog using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Python. Through hands-on exercises in Google Colab, participants will explore forest disturbance, land cover, and species composition across Canada using high-resolution datasets.\n",
